**Ploggify is a web service that combines running with environmental protection, allowing users to track and share their plogging activities.**

## 🤔 About The Project

With growing interest in health and the environment, "plogging" has emerged as a significant social movement. However, most existing running apps focus solely on performance metrics like distance and speed. They lack features to record and share key plogging activities such as litter quantity and cleanup routes, which limits user motivation for environmental protection.

Ploggify was created to solve this problem. Our goal is to create a new culture that combines exercise and environmentalism by integrating GPS-based run tracking with plogging activity logs. We empower users to enjoy both activities simultaneously and share their experiences with others.

**This is an open-source project, and we welcome anyone to use it and contribute freely.**

## ✨ Core Features

-   **[PLANNED] GPS-Based Plogging Route and Distance Tracking**: Accurately track and record users' running routes and distances via GPS.
-   **[PLANNED] Personal Dashboard & Challenges/Leaderboard**: Provide statistics on total plogging distance and litter collected, with weekly/monthly challenges to keep users motivated.
-   **[PLANNED] Plogging Route and Performance Sharing**: Allow users to share their plogging routes and achievements with others and receive 'likes'.
-   **[PLANNED] AI Object Detection for Litter Classification**: Automatically classify the type and quantity of litter from photos uploaded after a run.
-   **[PLANNED] Route Recommendation**: Recommend custom plogging routes based on collected data, such as areas with more or less litter, powered by AI.

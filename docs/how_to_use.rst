How to Use
===============================

Ploggify consists of three main tabs, seamlessly connecting the flow from starting a plogging activity to sharing it.

Step 1: Start Plogging and Route Recommendation (Start Tab)
-------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Get Route Recommendation: Tap 'Route Recommendation' at the top of the screen to set your goals (trash collection focused or exercise focused) and available time to receive optimal route suggestions.
    2. Start Plogging: Tap the "Start Plogging" button at the top to start the timer and draw the route on the map.
    3. End Activity: When finished, tap the "Stop" button to end the activity.

Step 2: Trash Image Analysis (AI Analysis)
----------------------------------------------

    1. Upload Photos: After plogging, tap the "Choose images" button to select photos of the collected trash.
    2. AI Analysis: Upload the photos and tap the "Analyze selected images" button. The AI model will automatically identify the types and counts of trash in the images.
    3. Check Results: A final session record containing the analyzed data (count by type, total trash amount) is created.

Step 3: Check Records and Statistics (Records and Dashboard)
--------------------------------------------------------------

    1. Check Records: In the "Records" tab, you can view detailed records of previous plogging sessions (distance, time, amount of trash collected, etc.).
    2. Statistics Dashboard: In the "Dashboard" tab, you can visually view statistical data such as total running distance and cumulative amount of collected trash.

      <div class="card-title">Why Ploggify?</div>
      <p class="card-subtitle">
        Inspired by apps like NRC and Strava, but with a missing piece:
        environmental impact. Ploggify logs not just pace and distance, but also
        how much trash you cleaned up along the way.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>✔ GPS route + distance tracking</li>
        <li>✔ Trash count and category logging</li>
        <li>✔ Personal dashboard & weekly reports</li>
        <li>✔ Social feed to share plogging runs</li>

  <h2 class="section-title">Key features</h2>
  <p class="section-subtitle">
    Similar to Apache Hadoop’s focus on scalable data processing, Ploggify focuses on
    tracking environmental data at scale — but for human-friendly plogging runs.
